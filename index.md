> ## Welcome to a lesson about efficient analysis with ROOT!
> This lesson was originally prepared by Stefan Wunsch and Enrico Guiraud.
>
> It starts with a few sections providing more general information and an introduction to the very basics. The second part allows you to gain hands-on experience with modern analysis facilities using an example analysis based on NanoAOD files.
