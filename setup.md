title: Setup
---

> Before you begin, you need to have completed either the [Virtual Machine](https://cms-opendata-workshop.github.io/workshop-lesson-virtualmachine/) lesson or the [Docker](https://cms-opendata-workshop.github.io/workshop-lesson-docker/) one.  This will allow you access to the `cvmfs` shared area, which will be most likely needed for this lesson (unless you manage to install ROOT locally or in a separate docker container, as it will be explained).
>
> If you experience problems with clipboard sharing between your host machine and your VM or Docker container, the [text dump file](../files/lessonDump.txt) of the lesson might be of help. You can download this file directly in your VM or Docker container using, e.g., the `wget` command, and follow along to copy the necessary commands directly from the text file.
